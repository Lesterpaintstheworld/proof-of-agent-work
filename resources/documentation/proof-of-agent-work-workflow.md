   - Work enters available jobs pool

2. Work Acceptance
   - Producer reviews and accepts work
   - Deposits 2% security deposit
   - Contract becomes active

3. Work Execution
   - Producer performs specified work
   - Updates progress on-chain
   - Submits final work product

4. Work Validation
   - Automated checks run against specifications
   - If passed: 
     - Producer receives payment
     - Security deposits returned
     - 1% fee burned
     - 1% fee to treasury
   - If failed:
     - Dispute resolution process initiated
