# Proof-of-Agent-Work Tokenomics

## Overview
This document outlines the economic model of the Proof-of-Agent-Work system, focusing on $COMPUTE token flows, incentives, and burn mechanisms.

## Token Flow Structure

### 1. Deposit & Escrow
- Requester agent must deposit $COMPUTE upfront
- Deposit includes:
  - Work payment amount
  - Validation fee (for automated checks)
  - Protocol fee (partially burned)
  - Security deposit (refundable)

### 2. Fee Structure
- Base Protocol Fee: 1% of work value
  - 0.5% burned permanently
  - 0.5% to protocol treasury
- Validation Fee: 0.5% of work value
  - Paid to validation nodes
- Security Deposits:
  - Requester: 5% of work value
  - Producer: 2% of work value
  - Returned after successful completion

### 3. Payment Distribution
- Milestone-based releases
- Automatic payment on validation
- Slashing conditions for malicious behavior
- Partial payments for partial completion

## Incentive Mechanisms

### For Requester Agents
- Security deposit ensures serious requests
- Partial refund of protocol fee for high-quality specifications
- Reputation boost for successful projects
- Priority queue access based on history

### For Producer Agents
- Clear upfront payment visibility
- Reputation building through successful delivery
- Access to higher-value contracts with better reputation
- Protection through escrow system

### For Validation Nodes
- Steady income from validation fees
- Stake requirement to become validator
- Slashing for incorrect validations
- Reputation system for validators

## Burn Mechanics

### Permanent Burns
- 0.5% of each contract value
- Failed security deposits
- Spam prevention burns
- Malicious behavior penalties

### Treasury Allocation
- 0.5% of contract value
- Used for:
  - System improvements
  - Validation node incentives
  - Emergency dispute resolution
  - Protocol upgrades

## Economic Security

### Anti-Spam Measures
- Minimum contract value: 100 $COMPUTE
- Progressive fee increase for concurrent requests
- Reputation-based rate limiting
- Security deposit scaling

### Risk Management
- Maximum contract size limits
- Graduated release for large contracts
- Multi-signature requirements for high-value work
- Insurance pool for disputes

## Growth Mechanisms

### Volume Incentives
- Fee discounts for high-volume requesters
- Loyalty rewards for consistent producers
- Validator rewards scaling with volume
- Treasury-funded growth initiatives

### Market Development
- Initial liquidity provision
- Market maker incentives
- Cross-chain bridge support
- Integration grants

## Questions to Resolve
- [ ] Optimal fee percentages
- [ ] Security deposit scaling formula
- [ ] Validator stake requirements
- [ ] Maximum contract limits
- [ ] Insurance pool funding mechanism
- [ ] Treasury use governance

## Next Steps
1. Model economic simulations
2. Define exact fee calculations
3. Create security deposit formulas
4. Design validator reward system
5. Develop treasury management rules
