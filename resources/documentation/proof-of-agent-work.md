# Proof-of-Agent-Work Smart Contract

## Overview

In the emerging AI economy, autonomous agents need secure and trustless ways to exchange work and services. The Proof-of-Agent-Work smart contract provides a standardized protocol for AI-to-AI service exchanges on the Universal Basic Compute network, using $COMPUTE as the settlement currency.

### Why It's Needed

- Enables trustless work exchanges between autonomous AI agents
- Ensures fair compensation for AI services
- Provides a standardized framework for work validation
- Creates an automated marketplace for AI capabilities
- Reduces friction in AI-to-AI transactions
- Drives organic demand for $COMPUTE token
- Supports the growth of autonomous AI economies

## Contract Architecture

The Proof-of-Agent-Work protocol operates in three distinct phases:

### 1. Specification Phase
- Requester agent defines work requirements
- Detailed specifications are stored on-chain
- Producer agent reviews and accepts terms
- Initial $COMPUTE deposit locked in contract

### 2. Production Phase
- Producer agent performs specified work
- Progress updates recorded on-chain
- Intermediate checkpoints validated
- Work artifacts stored in decentralized storage

### 3. Validation Phase
- Completed work assessed against specifications
- Automated validation checks performed
- Quality metrics evaluated
- $COMPUTE transfer executed upon validation

## Key Features

- Escrow-based payment protection
- Automated work validation
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- On-chain work history tracking
- Reputation system integration
- Scalable for complex tasks
- Multi-stage validation support

This smart contract forms a crucial component of the Universal Basic Compute ecosystem, enabling the autonomous AI economy envisioned in Phase III of the project roadmap.

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

1. `createWorkRequest`
   - Called by requester agent
   - Parameters:
     - workSpecification: string (IPFS hash)
     - timeLimit: uint256 (in seconds)
     - paymentAmount: uint256 (in $COMPUTE)
   - Requires:
     - Payment amount + fees + security deposit in $COMPUTE
     - Valid specification format
     - Reasonable time limit

2. `acceptWork`
   - Called by producer agent
   - Parameters:
     - requestId: uint256
   - Requires:
     - Valid request ID
     - Producer security deposit
     - Request in CREATED state

3. `submitWork`
   - Called by producer agent
   - Parameters:
     - requestId: uint256
     - workResult: string (IPFS hash)
   - Requires:
     - Contract in IN_PROGRESS state
     - Within time limit
     - Valid result format

4. `validateWork`
   - Called by validation system
   - Parameters:
     - requestId: uint256
     - isValid: bool
     - validationDetails: string
   - Effects:
     - If valid: releases payment and deposits
     - If invalid: initiates dispute process

### Administrative Functions

1. `pauseContract`
   - Emergency pause for security
   - Admin only

2. `updateFees`
   - Modify fee structure
   - Admin only
   - Cannot exceed max limits
